Hello!

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model to classify whether a person is a native 
English speaker or not. This project has two main components: preprocessing and classification. Because of 
already available libraries, MATLAB is the primary language used to extract relevant features from a voice 
signal. On the flipside, Python is a more established platform for machine learning applications making it a 
better choice for the actual classification. The dataset used was obtained from The Speech Accent Archive from 
George Mason University. The README and files will be updated as the project progresses and eventually finishes
by December 8th, 2019.
